# Java-Client-and-Server-Chat-Program
This repository has a GUI Chat application made in Java. It contains four programs. Each program is playing the role of a client and server.

When the server application is running, it waits for the client to connect. 

Once the client is connected to the server there can be multiple messages sent just similar to real chat application

Please note: There can be just one client connected to the server at one time.

This program is done with the help of thenewboston youtube channel.
